I loved you, and I probably still do,


And for a while the feeling may remain...


But let my love no longer trouble you,


I do not wish to cause you any pain.


I loved you; and the hopelessness I knew,


The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -


Made up a love so tender and so true


As may God grant you to be loved again.
